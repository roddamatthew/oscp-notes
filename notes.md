# Starting Point

*A note to me, in a few months*

Currently, I know a little bit about pentesting. I know that you should start with enumeration, and there's many tools to do this, most famously nmap.

I know a little about sys admin on Linux. I know very little about sys admin on Windows. I know broadly about common web attacks like SQL injections, directory enumeration, etc.

The more I write, the more I realize how little I know about these things tbh. Instead, I've decided to put a little score against each broad concept depicting how much I think I know. Here we go:

- Web: 2/5
    - I think I know my way around most web network protocols
    - I know about SQL injections, but not how to exploit them reliably.
    - Local/Remote file inclusions, file upload vulnerabilities, OS command injections all make sense to me conceptually but I don't know much about them.
    - XSS seems weird. How can we pivot from our browser to changing what JS the server serves?
    - I've messed around with gobuster and BurpSuite before.
- Linux: 2/5
    - I know my way around the linux filesystem
    - I know about user and group permissions. Changing who owns a file doesn't make much sense to me yet. Is there something the owner can do that an equivalently privileged user can't?
    - I don't think `find` has ever actually helped me find something.
    - Understanding environment variables and the PATH will be good.
    - IDK what SUID/GUID binaries are
    - `sudo` is `sudo`.
    - Password storing is unknown to me 
    - `cronjobs` I understand conceptually
    - Basic tools I think I probably know in more depth than is required, which is good.
    - `ps` is easy, `netstat` I think I'll pickup fast.
- Windows: 1/5
- Password Attacks: 1/5
- Using Existing Exploits: 0/5
- Port Forwarding and Pivoting: 2/5
- Active Directory: 0/5
- Client-Side Attacks: 0/5
- Report Writing: 3/5, how hard can it be :smirk:
- Misc.
