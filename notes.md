# Starting Point

*A note to me, in a few months*

Currently, I know a little bit about pentesting. I know that you should start with enumeration, and there's many tools to do this, most famously nmap.

I know a little about sys admin on Linux. I know very little about sys admin on Windows. I know broadly about common web attacks like SQL injections, directory enumeration, etc.
