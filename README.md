My notes for OSCP. Read at your own peril :computer:

OSCP has 25 modules, following the blog post [here](https://blog.leonardotamiano.xyz/tech/oscp-technical-guide/), they seem to nicely sort into the following broad concepts:

- Web
- Linux
- Windows
- Password Attacks
- Using Existing Exploits
- Port Forwarding and Pivoting
- Active Directory
- Client-Side Attacks
- Report Writing
- Misc.
