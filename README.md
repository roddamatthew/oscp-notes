# Introduction

My notes for OSCP. Read at your own peril :computer:

OSCP has 25 modules, following the blog post [here](https://blog.leonardotamiano.xyz/tech/oscp-technical-guide/), they seem to nicely sort into the following broad concepts, seperated into two categories:

1. Technological Concepts:
    - Web
    - Linux
    - Windows
    - Active Directory
2. Techniques:
    - Password Attacks
    - Using Existing Exploits
    - Port Forwarding and Pivoting
    - Active Directory
    - Client-Side Attacks
    - Report Writing
    - Misc.

OSCP is not meant to go into extreme depth in any one area, rather provide an introduction to a breadth of areas. This is disappointing by perhaps makes it more tractable. Anyone can generalize :smile:.
